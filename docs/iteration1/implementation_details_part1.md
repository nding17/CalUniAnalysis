# Implementation Summary 1

## Prompt

Implementation Summary (2): A separate document as Word or PDF is given that describes how your team collaborated on this project.  Everyone should have made clear contributions and the work should be split so that everyone is doing data science tasks (while I do consider it to be important to write the summary, etc. I want to make sure everyone is getting practice with processing data with Python). The summary should also give me any information I need to run your code. This should include a link to your GitHub repository (where you should have added me as a collaborator!).
