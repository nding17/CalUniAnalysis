- There is only a 1000 california schools. Put the CDS codes in manually.
- Merge our current dataset with our test scores dataset (and distances if that is available)
- Divide our dataset by UC campus - we make predictions for each campus, not all of them at the same time
- First model:
  - Divide our data by year. Each year is going to be a single data point for our model.
  - Divide the number of students in each school by the total number of applicants (this way we have everything on a 0-1 scale, which is what we want for the output)
  - Our features will be:
    - For each school:
      - Number of applied
      - Number of accepted
      - GPA of applied
      - GPA of accepted
      - SAT scores
      - AP scores
      - High school enrollment
      - High school distance from the UC campus
    - Year
  - Run that through linear regression on a 70/30 split, see what we get.
- Second model:
  - As before but do cross validation instead
- Third model:
  - As original, but generate random rows where we only use like 30 high schools, and everything else has `Number of applied/accepted` of 0.
  - Generate a dataset with something like 3000 rows and train.
  - See if there is any improvement
- Fourth model:
  - We should have enough data for a neural net. See if that works better.
