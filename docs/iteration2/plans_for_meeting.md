* Is there correlation between GPA and yield?
* How does the yield for each school vary over time? Maybe this is just a purely random variable, and we will never be able to find a input variable that could explain this . Are we trying to predict the results of the NBA playoffs from the price of tea in China?
* Is there correlation between yield and high school? Some schools have higher/lower yield rates, but they stay fairly constant throughout time.
* We should find other demographic data on each school, maybe we can find the cause of this. (https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/)
  * number students per school
  * avg SAT score per high school
  * income of county
  * ...
* What is our baseline model? Maybe just use the average yield for all schools? Average yield per high-school?
* What is our evaluating function? RMSE? Are we using yield ratio or the straight yield number?


STEPS:

- Fix region assignment
- Add new data to notebook (cleaning)



- New visualizations:
  - Preference to students from out of state
  - Admission vs SAT scores, ACT scores
  - Yield vs SAT scored, ACT scores
  - Yield/Admission by race
 
- Correlations:
  - GPA vs yield/admission
  - School vs yield/admission
  - SAT/ACT vs yield/admission
